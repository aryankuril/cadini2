# Project Structure and Technologies

- `/` - Source files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- `/assets` - Images, fonts, and other static assets
- `/lib` - Third-party libraries
- `/utils` - Utility functions

# Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup for content structure
- **CSS3** - Modern styling for visual presentation
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Core functionality and animations
- **GSAP** - Animation library for smooth transitions and effects
- **Locomotive Scroll** - Smooth scrolling library with parallax capabilities
- **Shopify** - Final integration target

# Code Conventions

- Use BEM methodology for CSS class naming
- Follow component-based organization for JS files
- Maintain responsive design principles throughout
- Prefer ES6+ syntax and features
- Keep animation logic separated from business logic

# Animation Guidelines

- Initialize GSAP animations in dedicated files
- Use GSAP timelines for complex sequences
- Implement scroll-triggered animations using ScrollTrigger
- Configure Locomotive Scroll for smooth scrolling experiences
- Optimize animations for performance

# Responsive

- Follow a **mobile-first approach** using media queries for larger breakpoints
- Use relative units (`rem`, `em`, `%`, `vh`, `vw`) for scalable layouts
- Ensure all components adapt fluidly across common screen sizes (320px to 1920px+)
